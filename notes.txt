I think the H9 model is working as it should. It runs with lots of trees and they gradually get bigger and thin. LAI and NPP seem reasonable. Added random component to GPP otherwise seem to converge for some reason, even though random initial diameters. Why is this? Perhaps it means the model is not sensitive to initial conditions, which would be good?

Next need to check that the crown area packing is working OK (draw movie of the canopy structure), together with the LAI control. This is really the key thing before moving on. If it is, could consider a below-ground similar approach, and an herbaceous layer. Make GPP more sophisticated to allow for CO2 effects, N effects, etc.
Then, when all seems good, add the full grow_up approach, and do some experiments! Add as an option, rather than overwrite what already works.
Will need mortality based on carbon balance as well, at some point, and will need to add plant type variation. Thought SLA would be something to consider early on.
Add regeneration routine (perhaps not a priority).

Catch up on where was with this ahead of meeting with Tim.

First, some key commands from the command line:

git pull <remoteneame> <branchname>
git pull https://github.com/adfriend45/H9

git add EXECUTE
git commit
git push
git push https://github.com/adfriend45/H9

/Users/adf10/H9/git fetch https://github.com/adfriend45/H9 seemed to work

---------------------------
Adding array of living tree indices so do not need to shift all variables each time one dies, and to use for diagnostics (Tim's graphics).
Before change, LAI = 7.1, H = 57.24.

Working carefully through code as does not give the same result when change things like write statements. Need to check if fPAR sums to correct total and work out general light profile stuff as a priority.

-------------------------
Continuing going through code very carefully. Variable by variable. Correct/improved sorting of dead KIs and made foliage area density constant yesterday. Also made nice output of each variable in a window when growing one tree. Thought that maybe crown shape could change, that is, crown diameter could change if not enough space for it. Makes sense - in fact that is what happens already in the model as all crown areas are reduced to fit the plot. For now have crown depth doing something odd when small. Why?
Presumably too much foliage area for possible crown volume when small.
Plot canopy volume and foliage area over time.
When larger ih falls when plot limits are reached.
When small, ih goes negative. Maybe just that Acrown is taken from last timestep, which is 1 yr.
Moved Acrown calculation above ib calculation, and now does not go negative.
But, Acrown limited later by plot area, so how deal with ib then? A bit complicated as all trees are reduced if they in total are more than plot area. So, recalculate after final Acrown is known, and adjust foliage areas and Aheart if not enough depth available.
A sensible approach seems to be to use the foliage area density as the ultimate constraint. Height fixed from D, and potential crown diameter fixed from D, giving potential crown volume. This is filled if sapwood area is enough, otherwise crown volume is reduced to keep foliage area density constant.
Next work on the squeezing algorithm. I do not see how it works at moment.

OK, working as before with single tree. Now need to work up squeeze in trees_structure.f90.

Found some really good notes on Fortran90, makefiles, modules, etc.:
http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/docs/course-notes/unix-courses/Fortran/files/paper_08.pdf
Would like to start to assess effects of assumptions, so need to create system
where can do this easily. First, look at effect of adding constraint on rate of
branch extension, say 10 cm/yr. Could squeezing also have a maximum rate constant?
